Step 1 - Hit the giphy API
	will use ajax function, with method "GET", to hit/ping giphy API, using an on click event.

	Need to set a limit of responses = to 10.
		Also need to include the rating of giph
Step 2 - Watch the demo video
	watched about 100+ time (feels like recursion (ha ha))

Step 3 - Make an array of things
	This is where the "magic" happens, so to speak.

	Need to make an array of buttons
		each button has an on click event, so that it "GETS" the button specific ID to return the giphy results.

	The on click event has a limit of 10 results

	With the 10 results showing, there needs to be a click function to switch between animated, and still.

	Need to take "user input", and add it to the array. There will need to be "render buttons" kind of function, and a for loop, so that when "user input" is entered, it "pushes" that input to the array, without repeating the already existing array values.

	As mentioned above, must display the rating of each image on the page. (rating provided by giphy api).

Step 4 - Rejoice
	Although this step says that I made something really cool. All I've accomplished so far is to *roughly* pseudo code what I interpreted to be the desire result.
